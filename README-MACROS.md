# Translatable macros

The sole purpose of this crate is exporting macros for the [translatable](https://crates.io/crates/translatable)
package, using this crate without the other one is not supported, and support requests or bug reports
for the use of this will redirect you to use [translatable](https://crates.io/crates/translatable).

## Licensing

Licensing for this crate follows the [translatable](https://crates.io/crates/translatable) licensing,
as they are essentially the same package.
