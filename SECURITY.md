# Security Vulnerabilities

**If you find any security issues, please reach out to any of the maintainers
listed in our [governance.md].** We take all security reports seriously and
will get back to you as soon as possible.

We also have security measures in place by using automated tools for managing dependencies.
Our project **strongly** relies on [dependabot] to:

- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies when needed
- Maintain all dependencies up to date

This automated system helps us apply security patches regularly, reducing the
need for manual checks on dependencies and ensuring that we are using the
latest versions of libraries to prevent security issues.
