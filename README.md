A robust internationalization solution for Rust featuring compile-time validation, ISO 639-1 compliance, and TOML-based translation management.

**This library prioritizes ergonomics over raw performance.**
Our goal is not to be *blazingly fast* but to provide the most user-friendly experience for implementing translations‚Äîwhether you're a first-time user or an experienced developer. If you require maximum performance, consider alternative libraries, a custom implementation, or even hard-coded values on the stack.

## Features üöÄ

- **ISO 639-1 Standard**: Full support for 180+ language codes/names.
- **Adaptative optimizations**: Optimizations generated depending on call dynamism.
- **Translation templating**: Make replacements with templates on your translations out of the box.
- **Compile-Time validation**: Error reporting with *rust-analyzer* for static parameters.
- **Custom file structure**: Translatable uses a walkdir implementation. Configure your translations folder.
- **Conflict resolution**: Define translation processing rules with a `translatable.toml` file in the root directory.

## Use Cases üîç

You may use translatable to write responses in back-end applications. Here is
an example of how you can integrate this with [actix-web](https://actix.rs/).

```rust
use actix_web::{HttpRequest, HttpResponse, Responder, get};
use translatable::{translation, Language};

#[get("/echo")]
pub async fn get_echo(req: HttpRequest) -> impl Responder {
    let language = req
        .headers()
        .get("Accept-Language")
        .and_then(|v| v.as_str().ok())
        .and_then(|v| v.parse::<Language>().ok())
        .unwrap_or(Language::EN);

    HttpResponse::Ok()
        .body(
            match translation!(language, static routes::responses::get_echo) {
                Ok(t) => t,
                Err(err) => concat!("Translation error ", err.to_string())
            }
        )
}
```

Or use it for front-end with [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/).

```rust
use leptos::prelude::*;
use translatable::{translation, Language};

#[component]
pub fn Greeting(language: Language) -> impl IntoView {
    let message = match translation!(language, static pages::misc::greeting) {
        Ok(t) => t,
        Err(err) => {
            log::error!("Translation error {err:#}");
            "Translation error.".into()
        }
    };

    view! {
        <h1>{ message }</h1>
    }
}
```

## Installation üì¶

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` under the `dependencies` section

```toml
translatable = "1.0.0"
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Configuration

There are things you can configure on how translations are loaded from the folder, for this
you should make a `translatable.toml` in the root of the project, and abide by the following
configuration values.

| Key       | Value type                         | Description                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `path`      | `String`                             | Where the translation files will be stored, non translation files in that folder will cause errors.                            |
| `seek_mode` | `"alphabetical"` \| `"unalphabetical"` | The found translations are ordered by file name, based on this field.                                                          |
| `overlap`   | `"overwrite"` \| `"ignore"`            | Orderly if a translation is found `"overwrite"` will keep searching for translations and `"ignore"` will preserve the current one. |

`seek_mode` and `overlap` only reverse the translations as convenient, this way the process
doesn't get repeated every time a translation is loaded.

### Translation file format

All the translation files are going to be loaded from the path specified in the configuration,
all the files inside the path must be TOML files and sub folders, a `walk_dir` algorithm is used
to load all the translations inside that folder.

The translation files have three rules
- Objects can only contain objects and translations. Top level can only contain objects.
- If an object contains another object, it can only contain other objects (known as nested object).
- If an object contains a string, it can only contain other strings (known as translation object).

Translation strings can contain templates, you may add sets of braces to the string with a key inside
and replace them while loading the translations with the macro.

### Loading translations

The load configuration such as `seek_mode` and `overlap` is not relevant here, as previously
specified, these configuration values only get applied once by reversing the translations conveniently.

To load translations you make use of the `translatable::translation` macro, that macro requires at least two
parameters to be passed.

The first parameter consists of the language which can be passed dynamically as a variable or an expression
that resolves to a `Translatable::Language`, or statically as a `&'static str` literal. For static values, the translation must comply with the `ISO 639-1` standard, as it is parsed to a `Translatable::Language` in compile time.

The second parameter consists of the path, which can be passed dynamically as a variable or an expression
that resolves to a `Vec<impl ToString>` containing each path section, or statically with the following
syntax `static path::to::translation`.

The rest of parameters are `meta-variable patterns` also known as `key = value` parameters or key-value pairs,
these are processed as replaces, *or format if the call is all-static*. When a template (`{}`) is found with
the name of a key inside it gets replaced for whatever is the `Display` implementation of the value. This meaning
that the value must always implement `Display`. Otherwise, if you want to have a `{}` inside your translation,
you can escape it the same way `format!` does, by using `{{}}`. Just like object construction works in rust, if
you have a parameter like `x = x`, you can shorten it to `x`. The keys inside braces are XID validated.

Have in mind that templates are specific to each translation, each language can contain it's own set
of templates, it is recommended that while loading a translation all the possible templates and combinations
are set if the language is dynamic. Templates are not validated, they are just replaced if found, otherwise
ignored, if not found the original template will remain untouched.

Depending on whether the parameters are static or dynamic the macro will act different, differing whether
the checks are compile-time or run-time, the following table is a macro behavior matrix.

| Parameters                                         | Compile-Time checks               | Return type             |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `static language` + `static path` (most optimized) | Path existence, Language validity | `String`                |
| `dynamic language` + `dynamic path`                | None                              | `Result<String, Error>` |
| `static language` + `dynamic path`                 | Language validity                 | `Result<String, Error>` |
| `dynamic language` + `static path` (commonly used) | Path existence                    | `Result<String, Error>` |

- For the error handling, if you want to integrate this with `thiserror` you can use a `#[from] translatable::Error`,
as a nested error, all the errors implement display.

- The runtime errors implement a `cause()` method that returns a heap allocated `String` with the error reason, essentially the error display. That method is marked with `#[cold]`, use it in paths that don't evaluate all the time,
prefer using `or_else` than `or` which are lazy loaded methods.

## Example implementation üìÇ

The following examples are an example application structure for a possible
real project.

### Example application tree

```plain
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ translatable.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ translations/
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs
```

### Example translation file (translations/app.toml)

Notice how `common.greeting` has a template named `name`.

```toml
[welcome_message]
en = "Welcome to our app!"
es = "¬°Bienvenido a nuestra aplicaci√≥n!"

[common.greeting]
en = "Hello {name}!"
es = "¬°Hola {name}!"
```

### Example application usage

Notice how there is a template, this template is being replaced by the
`name = "john"` key value pair passed as third parameter.

```rust
use translatable::{translation, Language};

fn main() {
    let dynamic_lang = header.parse::<Language>();
    let dynamic_path = vec!["common", "greeting"];

    assert!(translation!("es", static common::greeting, name = "john") == "¬°Hola john!");
    assert!(translation!("es", dynamic_path, name = "john").unwrap() == "¬°Hola john!".into());
    assert!(translation!(dynamic_lang, static common::greeting, name = "john").unwrap() == "¬°Hola john!".into());
    assert!(translation!(dynamic_lang, dynamic_path, name = "john").unwrap() == "¬°Hola john!".into());
}
```
